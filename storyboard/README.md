## Storyboard (Round 2)

<br>

### 1. Story Outline:
<br>


This
experiment is based on how to measure pressure applied at piezoelectric
transducer with the help of differential amplifier and digital meter by calibrating
the gain control knob of amplifier.
<br>
Firstly
the user will make the proper connection of the piezoelectric transducer,
differential amplifier and digital meter. After that apply the pressure by
selecting the different values shown in the input to be measured at
piezoelectric transducer some output is shown at digital meter. Then calibrate
the amplifier using the gain control knob in such a way that same output value
is shown as input selected numerically. Finally user will directly measure the
pressure applied at piezoelectric transducer.

<br>

The
simulator will perform operations in interaction with user, and value of
applied pressure is obtained.

<br>


### 2. Story:

<br>

This
experiment is based on how to measure pressure applied at piezoelectric
transducer with the help of differential amplifier and digital meter by
calibrating the gain control knob of amplifier.

<br>

When
user clicks on the simulation button, simulator for the measurement of pressure
using piezoelectric transducer opens up.The simulator screen is partitioned
into five areas namely Canvas working area, Power switch and equipment area, instruction
area, input switches area and last output reading area.
<br>


First
the working area is the space provided in the simulator so that user place the
equipment and draw the circuits according to the instruction shown in the
instruction area. In starting there is no equipment in the working area. Then
from power and equipment area user firstly switch on the simulator and then
select different equipment to completer the circuit. After completing the
circuit according to the instruction in the instruction window, if instruction
is not followed properly the a message in lower tab is shown. Then switch on
the circuit button from input switch area and output is shown in the output
reading area.

<br>

Then
user have to calibrate the output meter with the help of gain control knob of
differential amplifier which is provided in the input switch area in such a way
that the output shown in the output meter is numerically equal to the applied
input pressure. After that apply the pressure which is to be measured and the
output is obtained accordingly.

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
<br>


When
the user enters the simulator, he sees a screen divided into 2 columns
consisting of two and three rows individually. That indicates that a total of
five blocks. 
<br>


The
first block in first column contains our main canvas (circuit board). The
second block in first column circuit equipment contain Enable/disable Switch,
piezoelectric transducer, differential amplifier, output meter and connecting
wires.

<br>

The
second column, the first-row instructions appear as soon as everyone presses
the button of equipments and wires (follow the instructions) they change
subsequently. Below that contains Switch to ON the supply and input applied
pressure switch. 

<br>

In, second
column and last row shows the output metering box where output is shown in both
analog and in digital form.

<br>

Instructions
are as follows:

<br>

Step
1: Click on the ON button to start the Simulator.
<br>


Step
2: Now click on selector switch of different equipments

<br>

Step
3: connect the components by clicking on their specified buttons.

<br>

Step
4:  connect the wires

<br>

Step
5: change input to see corresponding output in output meter


<br>
Step
6: Calibrate the output meter with the help of gain control  knob of differential amplifier.


<br>
Step
7: Now apply the input pressure and get the output numerically equal to the
input applied pressure.

<br>

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:



Whenever a student tries to do something wrong.
i.e not according to the instructions. He will get a bottom up message on the
tab to make it right along with the instructions.  

<br>
##### 2.6 Conclusion:
<br>


The
user after using this simulator were able to know how to make connection for
measurement of the applied pressure with the help of piezoelectric transducer.
To use the simulator for applied pressure and calibrating it so that the output
shown is numerically equal to the applied input pressure takes nearly about 3-5mins
to proper understand and run the simulator. The simulator mainly focus on the
instrumentation and practical skills learned by the user. Learning objective
like how to make connection and how to measure the applied input pressure  is achieved by the designed simulator.
